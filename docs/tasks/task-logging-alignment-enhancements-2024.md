- ✅ **LLM Processing**: Azure OpenAI requests, response processing, HTML generation
- ✅ **Database Operations**: All CRUD operations with data samples
- ✅ **UI Rendering**: Content preparation and delivery to frontend
- ✅ **User Edits**: CKEditor changes, save operations, content updates

## ✅ Enhancement 2: CKEditor Alignment Preservation System - **COMPLETED**

**Description:**
✅ **Successfully resolved** alignment preservation issues by implementing HTML preprocessing in CKEditor and enhancing the Word export pipeline to maintain text alignment from LLM output through final document export.

**Completed Implementation:**

### CKEditor Enhancement
- ✅ **Version Upgrade**: Migrated to CKEditor 5 DecoupledEditor v42.0.0
- ✅ **HTML Preprocessing Function** in `CKTextEditor.jsx`:
  ```javascript
  const prepareHtmlContent = (inputContent) => {
    // Convert div-level alignment to paragraph-level alignment
    const divCenterPattern = /<div[^>]*style[^>]*text-align:\s*center[^>]*>([\s\S]*?)<\/div>/gi;
    processedContent = processedContent.replace(divCenterPattern, (match, innerContent) => {
      return innerContent.replace(/<p([^>]*)>/gi, '<p$1 style="text-align: center;">');
    });
    // Similar processing for right and justify alignments
  };
  ```
- ✅ **Always-On WYSIWYG Mode**: Disabled view/edit mode switching for direct editing
- ✅ **Alignment Plugin Integration**: Full support for left, center, right, justify alignment
- ✅ **Content Preservation**: Minimal HTML sanitization to preserve LLM formatting

### Word Export Pipeline Enhancement
- ✅ **Enhanced HTML Parser** in `wordextract.py`:
  - BeautifulSoup4 integration for robust HTML parsing
  - Multi-format alignment support (inline styles, CSS classes, nested elements)
  - Div container alignment extraction and child paragraph processing
- ✅ **Alignment Extraction Algorithm**:
  ```python
  # Handle div containers with alignment that contain paragraphs
  for div_element in soup.find_all('div'):
      if div_element.get('style') and 'text-align:' in div_element.get('style'):
          # Extract alignment and apply to child paragraphs
          alignment = extract_alignment_from_style(div_element.get('style'))
          apply_alignment_to_children(div_element, alignment)
  ```

### Critical Data Validation Fix
- ✅ **WordGenerator Data Preservation**: Fixed missing alignment field in data validation
- ✅ **Before (broken)**: `clean_item` dictionary missing alignment field, causing data loss
- ✅ **After (fixed)**: Added `"alignment": item.get("alignment", "left")` to preserve alignment data
- ✅ **Impact**: Ensures alignment data flows through entire pipeline without loss

### Paragraph Alignment Application
- ✅ **Direct Word Paragraph Alignment**:
  ```python
  if alignment == "center":
      current_paragraph.alignment = WD_PARAGRAPH_ALIGNMENT.CENTER
  elif alignment == "right":
      current_paragraph.alignment = WD_PARAGRAPH_ALIGNMENT.RIGHT
  elif alignment == "justify":
      current_paragraph.alignment = WD_PARAGRAPH_ALIGNMENT.JUSTIFY
  ```
- ✅ **Validation Logging**: Debug output for alignment application verification
- ✅ **Fallback Handling**: Default left alignment for unspecified content

**Verification Results:**
1. ✅ **End-to-End Testing**: Confirmed alignment preservation from LLM → CKEditor → Word
2. ✅ **Multiple Format Support**: Tested with various HTML alignment formats
3. ✅ **User Validation**: Confirmed "the alignment worked well" from user testing
4. ✅ **Debug Tools**: Created standalone test scripts for alignment validation
