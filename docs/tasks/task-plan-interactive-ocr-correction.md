# Task: Implement Interactive OCR Correction Feature - âœ… COMPLETED

## Implementation Status: **FULLY COMPLETED AND OPERATIONAL**

All planned commits have been successfully implemented and the OCR correction workflow is fully functional in production. The implementation includes all originally planned features plus additional enhancements for better user experience.

## âœ… Commit 1: feat: Add backend services for editable PDF processing and text comparison - **COMPLETED**
**Description:**
âœ… **Successfully implemented** new services in the backend to handle the "editable PDF" (Document B) and compare its text with the OCR'd text from Document A.

**Completed Implementation:**
- âœ… **EditablePDFService** implemented in `backend/app/services/editable_pdf_service.py`:
    - Method to receive uploaded image-based PDF (Document B)
    - Uses `PyMuPDF` to extract existing text overlay page-by-page (no new OCR)
    - Stores/associates extracted text (`Text_B`) with original scanned document (Document A)
    - JSON serialization for page-by-page storage
- âœ… **TextComparisonService** implemented in `backend/app/services/text_comparison_service.py`:
    - Takes `Text_B` (page N) and `Text_A` (OCR text from Document A, page N)
    - Uses `difflib.SequenceMatcher` for accurate difference detection
    - Returns structured list of differences with type, original, suggested text, and indices
    - Optimized for large text blocks with performance considerations
- âœ… **Database Models** added in `backend/app/db/models.py`:
    - `EditablePDFText` table for storing Document B text per page
    - `CorrectedText` table for storing user corrections
- âœ… **Schema Definitions** in `backend/app/schemas/correction_schemas.py`:
    - Complete Pydantic models for all correction workflow requests/responses

**Verification Results:**
1. âœ… **Automated Tests**: Unit tests pass for both services with comprehensive coverage
2. âœ… **Logging**: Full logging implemented with configurable levels via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable

## âœ… Commit 2: feat: Implement backend API endpoints for OCR correction workflow - **COMPLETED**
**Description:**
âœ… **Successfully developed** FastAPI endpoints to support the complete interactive OCR correction workflow.

**Completed Implementation:**
- âœ… **Complete API Endpoints** in `backend/app/api/routes/correction.py`:
    - `POST /api/correction/documents/{document_id}/editable-pdf`: Upload Document B with full validation
    - `GET /api/correction/documents/{document_id}/compare/page/{page_number}`: Fetch comparison data with structured diffs
    - `POST /api/correction/documents/{document_id}/corrections/page/{page_number}`: Submit user corrections per page
    - `GET /api/correction/documents/{document_id}/corrected-text`: Retrieve final corrected text for export
    - `POST /api/correction/documents/{document_id}/finalize`: Mark correction process as complete
- âœ… **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and user-friendly error messages
- âœ… **Request/Response Models**: Complete Pydantic schema validation for all endpoints
- âœ… **File Management**: Proper upload handling with progress tracking and cleanup

**Verification Results:**
1. âœ… **Integration Tests**: All endpoints tested with various PDF types and error scenarios
2. âœ… **API Documentation**: Automatic OpenAPI docs with comprehensive endpoint descriptions
3. âœ… **Logging**: Complete request/response logging with performance monitoring
